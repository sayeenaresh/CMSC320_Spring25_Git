Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science is applicable to wildlife conservation for tracking and protection of endangered wildlife. With the application of machine learning, computer vision, and large data, researchers can process voluminous data that is captured with camera traps, drones, and environmental sensors. For example, AI algorithms are capable of sorting species automatically, tracking migration of animals, and detecting unusual activity that will trigger environmental stress or poaching. Additionally, predictive analytics can also aid conservationists to forecast habitat shifts due to climate shifts and urban development, making proactive measures taken in a bid to maintain biodiversity. It makes optimal decisions, ensures maximum resource utilization, and finally results in long-term survival of threatened species.
