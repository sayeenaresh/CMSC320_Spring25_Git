Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a highly capable version control system that ensures effective management of code by tracking changes over time so that developers can revisit previous versions whenever necessary. It enables easy collaboration by allowing several contributors to work on a project simultaneously while adhering to a disciplined workflow through branching and merging so that new functionality or fixes may be developed in isolation prior to integration. Additionally, Git has a safe backup mechanism so that work is never lost, and since it is distributed, it allows developers to work offline with a full copy of the repository. With built-in code integrity features using cryptographic hashing and widespread adoption in the industry, Git is an essential tool for software development today.
